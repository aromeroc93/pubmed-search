# PubMed search

This script is meant to be able to read from PubMed given a query and return desired papers. Can also perform routine searches of common terms of interest to find new hits and be up-to-date with research.

Current usage: `python3 pubmed-seach.py [query] [n]` where `n` is and integer defining the number of days to search.
